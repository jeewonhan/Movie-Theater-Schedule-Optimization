## Introduction
This section of my portfolio showcases a project entitled "Saving Cinema: Designing Movie Theater Showing Schedules." This data mining project adheres to the CRISP-DM Model and was completed as part of EN.553.602: Research and Design in Applied Mathematics: Data Mining at The Johns Hopkins Univerisity in the Fall of 2023. The work was carried out under the mentorship of Drew Henrichsen, alongside collaborators Lucas Rozendaal, Sam Oberly, Jay Lawrence, and Jillayne Clarke.

As is likely evident, this repository is a work in progress. This is for two reasons:

1. Our work on this project continues until the end of the 2023 calendar year.
2. While this project was a team effort, I am in the process of reviewing and editing all code for efficiency and clarity, tailoring it to suit the standards of my personal portfolio. The collaborative nature of the project led to several re-iterations of our work, resulting in duplicative, scattered, and at times disorganized work. The original repository for reference can be found here:

## Organization
Thus far, the project can be organized into 3 sections in accordance with the CRISP-DM model:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Understanding

For ease of access, major deliverables such as the Project Proposal and Data Preparation Report are found in 0. Deliverables.

## My Contributions
